She instead becomes more happy and active after wearing the glasses.", "pred": "The baby girl in the video is shown to be distressed after wearing the glasses, and there could be several reasons for this behavior. First, the glasses might be uncomfortable or too big for the baby's face, which could cause discomfort. Second, the baby might have gotten used to seeing things with its bare eyes and the glasses might be a novelty that makes it feel unfamiliar. Finally, the baby might be experiencing visual distortions due to the lenses.

As the video progresses, we see the baby playing with the ball and toys, which seems like an enjoyable and normal activity.

Additionally, the baby is shown standing on the ground with the mother and wearing a pink dress, which suggests that the baby is able to move around and interact with the environment, but perhaps not as easily or comfortably as she would without the glasses.
