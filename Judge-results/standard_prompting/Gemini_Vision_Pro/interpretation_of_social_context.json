Zoos typically have humans operating vehicles for safety and operational efficiency. A chimpanzee driving suggests an unusual or special scenario, likely staged or a rare event, not aligning with standard zoo practices.", "pred": " No, the driving activity shown in the video is not indicative of normal zoo operations. It is dangerous and could be harmful to both the animals and the visitors to the zoo."}], [{"pred": "incorrect", "score": 2, "reason": "The predicted answer is incorrect as it describes a Bornean orangutan driving a golf cart instead of a chimpanzee driving a zoo vehicle as shown in the video.

Driving requires understanding and operating controls in a specific sequence, indicating cognitive abilities above what is typically expected from animals, even those known for high intelligence like chimpanzees.", "pred": " The chimpanzee is likely very intelligent and well-trained. It is able to understand and follow instructions from the orangutan and is able to operate the golf buggy safely, which requires a certain level of intelligence and training.
